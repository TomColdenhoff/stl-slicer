# stl-slicer
A tool that exports slices from a stl file to a bmp.

# usage
Once you've build the source code you can run program from the console or terminal.
stl-slicer <file.stl> <slice-amount f.e 1063> <resolution f.e 200>

For example: ./stl-slicer stlfile.stl 1063 200

This command will slice the stl file 1063 times on the Z axis and output those as a bmp with a resolution of 200px.
